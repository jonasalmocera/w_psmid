Hi miss Pearl,

Regarding your concerns:
Contacts < Can't use add contacts, filter and select contacts simultaneously. The system was developed this way to separate sending by filters, individual and by uploading. //done
Messages < Compose < Parameter - add "Member ID" (same for message template). NOTED. This will be implemented. //done
Messages < Compose < You can remove full name, group, account name, date added (same for message template)  NOTED. This will be implemented. //done
Have drop down choices for filters ( branch, region) - can we do multiple selection NOTED. This will be implemented. (Multiple selection is accepted) //done
Concern
Gender and Network (not dropping down choices)  NOTED. This will be implemented //done
Is there a way to know how many SMS are to be sent after identifying contacts?  //done   NOTED. This will be implemented
